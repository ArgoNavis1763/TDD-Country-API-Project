# Country API TDD

In this application you will see that there have been tests already written but currently their is no functionality.


## Your Goals

1. Following the conventions of TDD, write the code so that all the tests shall pass.
2. Once all tests have passed create tests and code for the following scenarios...


## Scenarios
1. Find countries that use a certain currency
2. Find countries that are inside the 'Regional Blocs'
3. Find coutrnies that speak a certain language

## What Next?

1. Once you have finished the above scenarios can we make this node application use express to create our own endpoints we can consume these functions from?

2. Can we add a client side to our application?

3. Can we create a text box on our client side that when text is entered it searches the API for countries that match. If it matches it shows their flags and information about the nation.
